Library Management System is a software which handles the entire data of library. It makes the work of librarian very easy instead of writing data in a notebook. In past the librarians were using notebooks to write the data of books along with students name who borrowed that book. So it was very difficult to keep track on each and every book.  If librarian wantâ€™s to search for a particular book then that task was very time consuming. So to make this task easy the programming languages were developed and C++ language is one of them.
